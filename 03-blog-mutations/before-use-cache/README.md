# Before Getting Started

All changes to the starting code of this project are the same as the changes from the other `before` project. The only difference is this code uses the `dynamicIO` and `"use cache"` options for the caching sections.

## Instructions

All the instructions and additional information for this project are the same as the normal `before` project. The only difference is `dynamicIO` and `"use cache"` should be used for the caching sections. I have also already enabled the experimental `dynamicIO` feature in the `next.config.js` file.

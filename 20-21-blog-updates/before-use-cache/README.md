# Before Getting Started

The starting code for this project is identical to the starting code for the normal `before` project. The only difference is this project is created with a canary version of Next.js that supports `dynamicIO` and `"use cache"`.

## Instructions

All the instructions and additional information for this project are the same as the normal `before` project. The only difference is `dynamicIO` and `"use cache"` should be used for the caching sections. I have also already enabled the experimental `dynamicIO` feature in the `next.config.js` file.

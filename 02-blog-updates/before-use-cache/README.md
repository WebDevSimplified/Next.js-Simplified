# Before Getting Started

The starting code for this project is identical to the starting code for the normal `before` project. The only difference is I have enabled the `cacheComponents` feature in the `next.config.ts` file.

## Instructions

All the instructions and additional information for this project are the same as the normal `before` project. The only difference is `cacheComponents` with `"use cache"` should be used for the caching sections.
